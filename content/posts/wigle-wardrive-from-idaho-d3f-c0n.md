<p>Long time, no post! </p><p>Driving down from Idaho to Las Vegas for Black Hat, BSidesLV and D3F C0N. Figured, hey, what the heck, let's war drive!</p><p>I grabbed my trusty old Alfa USB WiFi card, Garmin eTrex Legend &amp; serial adaptor and a unused Raspberry Pi from the box-o-parts, installed Kismet and tossed it in the back of the car. Fingers crossed, I'll actually get some useful AP's scanned during this trip. Lazy-posting my wigle.net deets below, I'll update this post as we get more info...</p><p></p><p>-BadgerOps</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wigle.net/bi/LqEI7EgpdXIA6CpMPQ8qmQ.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
